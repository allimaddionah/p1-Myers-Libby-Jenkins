<p>Whether you are looking for a lively Flagstaff restaurant that serves great food or a top-notch coffeehouse with the ultimate cup, Macy’s European Coffeehouse and Bakery is the place you want to land. Locally owned and operated, Macy’s has been capturing customers’ hearts and loyalties for thirty plus years.</p>
<p>Macy’s is one of Flagstaff’s few all-vegetarian restaurants. We strive to provide the best bite around. Our menu ranges from flaky croissant and egg breakfast sandwiches to organic spinach salads; to a BLT made on homemade whole wheat to a mouth-watering burrito smothered in melted cheddar cheese and enchilada sauce.</p>
<p>Macy’s is also Flagstaff’s preferred watering hole. Local residents have voted Macy’s, “Best Coffeehouse” in the Arizona Daily Sun’s, Best of Flag contest, for ten plus years running. At Macys we put love into every cup, every step of the way; from the farm to your lips.</p>
<p>To complete the trifecta of awesomeness, this Flagstaff restaurant also offers you a full service bakery. We open with an array of breakfast pastries like muffins and scones. We close with thoughts of pumpkin pies and special order birthday cakes. Macy’s also proudly offers many vegan, gluten-free, and other special diet options that will leave your mouth watering.</p>
